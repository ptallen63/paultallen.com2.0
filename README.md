# Paultallen.com

This is my personal site. I chose to build it in the MERN stack.

## Stack

- ReactJS
- GatsbyJS
- Heroku
- Semantic UI


## TODO

I am constantly using this site as a testing ground. It tends to be in an eternal beta. 

## Coming Up

- [x] ~~Add Project section~~
- [x] ~~Project Screenshots Carousel~~
- [x] ~~Rewrite to be static site using GatsbyJS or NextJS~~
- [ ] Optimize Images --> CDN or Cloundanary
- [ ] Build out testing Suite
- [ ] Connect CI (Probably Travis)

# Exploring

- [ ] connecting a 3rd party DB to store resume data
